A simple phone contact app

This is still the begging, I just want to share the little project from start to end 

So today on 23.01.24 I created a "Add" command and a "View" command.

Today 30.01.24 I created a "Call" command wich helps me to find a number from the contact list and call it.

I think this will be for this prodject, because I have don't know what more I can do in it, so this is it.
